    In 1971, Watergate was just a hotel, NASA was preparing Apollo 15, 
    and a small Oregon company had just sold its first pair of shoes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shoe — a football boot called <strong>“the Nike”</strong> — retailed for $16.95. 
    Its defining feature was a checkmark-shaped stripe created by a Portland State 
    University student for just $35.
  </p>

  <p>
    Few noticed the shoe at the time, but the mark would long outlast it, 
    becoming one of the most recognizable symbols in sports and culture.

    At the time, Nike wasn’t yet the global sports brand it would become. 
    Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman were still operating as 
    <strong>Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS)</strong>, a small distributor of Japanese running shoes.
  </p>

  <p>
    As supplier contracts began to wind down, Knight realized the company’s future 
    depended on more than selling someone else’s product. To survive, BRS needed 
    a shoe of its own — and with it, an identity.
  </p>

  <p>
    In February of that year, Knight commissioned a factory in Mexico to produce 
    a black soccer cleat with a white sole. To distinguish it from Onitsuka Tiger models, 
    he needed a brand mark.
  </p>

  <p>
    He turned to <strong>Carolyn Davidson</strong>, a design student he had met while 
    teaching accounting at Portland State University — a decision that would shape 
    the future of sport forever.
