        Phil Knight grew up in Southeast Portland and attended Cleveland High School. 
        Early setbacks shaped his resilience — including being cut from his baseball team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Encouraged by his mother, Knight chose track over disappointment. 
        That single decision sparked a journey that would redefine athletics forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though physically smaller, Knight was fast, disciplined, and fiercely competitive. 
        His dedication soon paid off, earning recognition in Oregon’s elite prep scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        A pivotal moment came when his father introduced him to legendary Oregon track coach 
        <strong>Bill Bowerman</strong>. What began as a handshake would later become one of the 
        most influential partnerships in sports history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by Bowerman’s athletes and philosophy, Knight realized that sport could be 
        transformed through innovation, belief, and relentless effort.
